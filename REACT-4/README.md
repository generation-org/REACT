# REACT-4 Stateless and stateful components

 <br/>
 <br/>

# Creating a stateless component

Create a stateless component called colorfulParagraph. This component should be a piece of text with its color defined by props.color.

# Creating a stateful component

* Create a stateful component called colorChooser that has color as its state. 
* This color should be updated every second, sorted from an array of valid CSS colors.

# Stateless from stateful 

* Instantiate colorfulParagraph from colorChooser. What happens?
