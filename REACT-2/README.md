The base code for this exercise is [this](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/redirect-to-codepen/components-and-props/extracting-components-continued) one provided on codepen by React.org. It's copied here. Make sure you read the code and understand it before continuing.

# Part 1 - Creating components
* Create a new component called ContactInfo
* The component should have the following props:
    * E-mail
    * Phone number
    * Github profile link
* Style your component as you wish with CSS

# Part 2 - Integrating components
* Make the existing UserInfo component render your new ContactInfo component
* It's props should come from the const comment json defined in the code

# Part 3 - Class components
* Turn all components into classes instead of functions
